Welcome to my Github! 

I'm a global change biologist, and I study the relationship between climate change, emerging infectious diseases, and health security. I'm currently an Assistant Research Professor at Georgetown's [Center for Global Health Science and Security](https://ghss.georgetown.edu/). I also run a program called the [Verena Consortium](viralemergence.org), a team of majority early-career researchers developing open data and analytical tools to help predict which viruses could someday infect humans, which animals currently host them, and where they could emerge.
