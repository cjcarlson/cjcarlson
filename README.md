# Hi! I'm Colin. 👨‍🎤

🎓 I'm currently an Assistant Research Professor at Georgetown University. Check out what our lab works on [here](https://www.carlsonlab.bio). Our group is moving to Yale University in summer 2024. See you there!

🦠 I'm also director of the [Verena Institute](https://www.viralemergence.org), a team of researchers using artificial intelligence to predict the where, when, and how of viral emergence.

🔢 On my Github, you'll find work that uses machine learning and other kinds of data analytics to predict species distributions (like the [embarcadero R package](https://www.github.com/cjcarlson/embarcadero)), identify the signal of climate change impacts on infectious diseases, or otherwise solve complex problems at the interface between ecology and global health.
